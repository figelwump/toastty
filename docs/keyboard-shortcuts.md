# Keyboard Shortcuts

Toastty keeps the high-frequency workspace, pane, and agent actions on the keyboard. This reference groups the built-in shortcuts by task.

## Core window and workspace actions

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+N` | New window |
| `Cmd+T` | New tab |
| `Cmd+B` | Show or hide the sidebar |
| `Cmd+Shift+N` | New workspace |
| `Cmd+Shift+E` | Rename workspace |
| `Option+Shift+E` | Rename tab |
| `Cmd+Shift+W` | Close workspace |
| `Cmd+W` | Close focused panel |

`Cmd+W` and `File > Close` both use Toastty's panel-close behavior. The native red close button still asks for confirmation before closing the full window.

| `Cmd+Ctrl+Left Arrow` | Resize split left |
| `Cmd+Ctrl+Right Arrow` | Resize split right |

## Agents and terminal profiles

These shortcuts depend on configured profiles:

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+Ctrl+<key>` | Launch agent profile when the profile defines `shortcutKey` |
| `Cmd+Ctrl+<key>` | Split right with a terminal profile when the profile defines `shortcutKey` |
| `Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+<key>` | Split down with a terminal profile when the profile defines `shortcutKey` |

For agent setup details, see [running-agents.md](running-agents.md). For terminal profile setup details, see [terminal-profiles.md](terminal-profiles.md).
